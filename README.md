# Benchmarking and Improving Large Vision-Language Models for Fundamental Visual Graph Understanding and Reasoning
This repository contains the official implementation of our paper, **Benchmarking and Improving Large Vision-Language Models for Fundamental Visual Graph Understanding and Reasoning**.

We provide 10 visual graphs as references in this repository for each graph structure in VGCure and for each task in MCDGraph.

The **complete data** of VGCure and MCDGraph can be found [**Here**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WF3KyYTh3flhICzexoqHvV7OzWmxt1aB?usp=sharing).
