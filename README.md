# Benchmarking and Improving Large Vision-Language Models for Fundamental Visual Graph Understanding and Reasoning
This repository contains the official implementation of our paper, **Benchmarking and Improving Large Vision-Language Models for Fundamental Visual Graph Understanding and Reasoning**.

We provide 10 visual graphs as references in this repository [for each graph structure in VGCure](VGCure/images/) and [for each task in MCDGraph](MCDGraph/images/).

In addition, we also provide graphs with different visual styles drawn by `networkx` and `matplotlib` [here](VGCure/images_networkx/) for reference.

The **complete data** of VGCure and MCDGraph can be found in [**ðŸ¤—Huggingface**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AAAndyZ/VGCure) and [**Google Driver**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WF3KyYTh3flhICzexoqHvV7OzWmxt1aB?usp=sharing).
